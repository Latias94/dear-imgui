To migrate from `dear-imgui` 0.2.x to `dear-imgui-rs` 0.3.x:

1. Update your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   # Before
   dear-imgui = "0.2"

   # After
   dear-imgui-rs = "0.3"
   ```

2. Update your imports:
   ```rust
   // Before
   use dear_imgui::*;

   // After
   use dear_imgui_rs::*;
   ```

3. Update backend dependencies if you use them:
