//! Low-level FFI bindings for ImNodes via the cimnodes C API
//!
//! This crate provides raw, unsafe bindings to the ImNodes library using the
//! cimnodes C API, designed to work together with `dear-imgui-sys` (which uses
//! cimgui for Dear ImGui). This avoids C++ ABI issues and keeps builds
//! consistent across platforms and toolchains.
//!
//! This crate is typically not used directly. Prefer the high-level
//! `dear-imnodes` crate for safe bindings.
